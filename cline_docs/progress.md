# Progress

- **What Works**: The Memory Bank files have been initialized and updated with project information. The project plan has been reviewed and relevant information has been incorporated into the Memory Bank. The research document 'vector_search_arangodb.md' has been added to the Memory Bank. The project brief and build document have been added to the Memory Bank. An existing MCP server for ArangoDB has been found. The README.md file has been updated to reflect the new direction. The fetched README file for the ArangoDB MCP server has been added to the Memory Bank. The old MCP server setup has been removed. The README.md file has been integrated with the ArangoDB MCP server documentation. Instructions for setting up the ArangoDB MCP with Cline have been added to the README.md file. An acknowledgment to the original creator of the ArangoDB MCP server has been added to the README.md file. The Docker Compose file has been reviewed and confirmed to include a persistent storage location for ArangoDB. The README.md file has been updated to reflect the adjustment to our deployment. We have decided to use ArangoDB as a single solution for our multi-modal RAG solution, so we will not be using Milvus for vector storage and similarity searches. Instead, we will rely on ArangoDB's FAISS integration for vector operations.
- **What's Left to Build**: Set up ArangoDB in a Docker container, connect it to an Ollama instance, and develop a data ingestion and embedding pipeline.
- **Progress Status**: The Memory Bank is complete and ready for further development. The next steps involve setting up the Docker environment and connecting ArangoDB to Ollama.
