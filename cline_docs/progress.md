# Progress

- **What Works**: The Memory Bank files have been initialized and updated with project information. The project plan has been reviewed and relevant information has been incorporated into the Memory Bank. The research document 'vector_search_arangodb.md' has been added to the Memory Bank. The project brief and build document have been added to the Memory Bank. An existing MCP server for ArangoDB has been found. The README.md file has been updated to reflect the new direction. The fetched README file for the ArangoDB MCP server has been added to the Memory Bank.
- **What's Left to Build**: Set up ArangoDB in a Docker container, connect it to an Ollama instance, and develop a data ingestion and embedding pipeline.
- **Progress Status**: The Memory Bank is complete and ready for further development. The next steps involve setting up the Docker environment and connecting ArangoDB to Ollama.
