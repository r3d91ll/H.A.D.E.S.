# H.A.D.E.S Heuristic Adaptive Data Extraction System

## HADES backen with ArangoDB Integration

**Objective:** Develop a system that embeds data into ArangoDB as document, vector, and graph representations and enables efficient retrieval. The frontend is deferred to a later stage. The immediate focus is on backend integration and data flow.

- All docker environments should be constructed with a docker-compose.yml file
- any code provided below are only examples of how something could be done. 
- this is more than just the docker container for ArangoDB. Once we have the database up and running we will be crating a MCP server for ArangoDB

### 1. **Environment Setup**

 Sure! Here are the steps to set up ArangoDB in a Docker container and connect it to your Ollama instance:

1. Create a persistent volume: You can use docker volumes to persist data even if you stop or remove the container.

`docker volume create arangodb_data`

2. Configure the ArangoDB container:
Run the following command to start an ArangoDB container with the necessary configurations:

``` bash
docker run -d --name my-arangodb \
-p 8529:8529 \
-v arangodb_data:/var/lib/arangodb3 \
-e ARANGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=<your-password> \
arangodb/arangodb
```

This command starts a new container named `my-arangodb` with the ArangoDB image, mapping port 8529 of the host to port 8529 of the container. The `-v` flag mounts the previously created volume at `/var/lib/arangodb3`, and the `-e` flag sets the root password.

3. Establish a connection with Ollama:
To connect ArangoDB with your Ollama instance, you need to configure the Ollama settings file (`ollama.conf`) or use environment variables.

If using `ollama.conf`, add the following lines:

```
[database]
driver = "arangodb"
host = "<your-arangodb-host>"
port = 8529
username = "<your-username>"
password = "<your-password>"
name = "<your-database-name>"
```

Replace `<your-arangodb-host>`, `<your-username>`, and other placeholders with your actual values.

Alternatively, you can set the necessary environment variables when running Ollama:

`docker run -d --name my-ollama-instance -e DATABASE_DRIVER=arangodb -e DATABASE_HOST=<your-arangodb-host> -e DATABASE_PORT=8529 -e DATABASE_USERNAME=<your-username> -e DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your-password> -e DATABASE_NAME=<your-database-name> ollama/ollama`

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual values.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up ArangoDB in a Docker container and establish a connection with Ollama for your RAG database.

#### 2. **Data Ingestion and Embedding**

- **Document Storage:**
  - Structure the data as JSON documents for storage in ArangoDB.
  - Create collections for organizing data hierarchically (e.g., `Classes`, `Functions`, `Imports`).

- **Vector Representation:**
  - Utilize ArangoDB's FAISS integration to embed and store vectorized data.
  - Generate embeddings using a pre-trained model (e.g., Hugging Face or OpenAI) before inserting into the database.

- **Graph Representation:**
  - Design graph schemas to represent relationships between entities (e.g., classes, functions, imports).
  - Ingest data into ArangoDB's graph module, defining vertex collections (e.g., `Nodes`) and edge collections (e.g., `Links`).

---

#### 3. **Data Retrieval**

- **Query Documents:**
  - Use ArangoDB's AQL (Arango Query Language) for advanced document queries.

- **Vector Search:**
  - Implement vector similarity queries using FAISS integration for fast nearest-neighbor search.

- **Graph Traversals:**
  - Leverage graph traversal queries to explore relationships between entities.

---

#### 4. **Data Processing Pipeline**

- Develop a Python script or service to:
     1. **Input Data**: Parse and pre-process data for ingestion.
     2. **Embed Data**: Vectorize data using a selected embedding model.
     3. **Store Data**: Insert data into ArangoDB as documents, vectors, and graph entities.
     4. **Retrieve Data**: Implement basic retrieval functionality for documents, vectors, and graph traversals.

---

#### 5. **Testing and Validation**

- Verify the data ingestion process, ensuring all representations (document, vector, graph) are correctly stored.
- Test retrieval functionalities for:
  - Exact document queries.
  - Similarity-based vector queries.
  - Graph relationship queries.

---

#### 6. **Build Model Context Protocol Server**

- Once data ingestion and retrieval are functional, design an **MCP server** to interact with ArangoDB.
- Define APIs for embedding, querying, and updating data in ArangoDB.
- Ensure the MCP server supports flexible queries combining document, vector, and graph capabilities.

---

#### 7. **Future Enhancements**

- Explore fine-tuning embedding models for better integration with ArangoDB data.
- Expand the pipeline to handle batch processing and multi-threaded operations.
- Revisit frontend development to provide an interactive user interface for the system.
